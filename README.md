# Whereeeee
An android app which shows direction and distance to meet friends.
Our project gets users' locations that roughly tell users where their friends are now with a compass image and estimated distance. This “roughly” will make you easy to know where to head even if you have no sense of direction. Map apps usually show only a way from A to B but our app shows just only a direction and distance mainly using a compass. So you can understand “Go to that direction. Yes North.”
